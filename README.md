# xmlshow: A super-simple and powerful viewer for large XML files, for the command-line

## Introduction

### Features
xmlshow is a super-simple XML viewer for the command line, which should provide most everything you could wish,
since uses the features of [less](https://ss64.com/bash/less.html).

  - It will display any **large** XML file in a breeze.
  - It has syntax highlighting
  - If it is a zip file, it will unzip it in the process (zipping is *both* indispensable and effective, 
    since XML is wonderfully redundant).
  - It has line numbering
  - You can navigate forward and backward
  - You can use sed search patterns.

### Limitations
There are two things, however, that it won't do:
  - Modifying the file
  - Prepare or serve coffee

### Usage
Just type:

    $ xmlshow <filename>
    
## How it works
It combines:

  - unzip, to extract the file
  - [xmllint](http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html), for beautifying the XML.
  - highlight to highlight the syntax
  - [less](https://ss64.com/bash/less.html) to view the file
    
That's all there is to it. It's just a hack with *Nix pipes.

## How to install it

  1. Download the .sh file an install it some directory in your path (type `echo $PATH`to find out).
  2. Make it executable: `chmod +x xmlshow.sh`
  2. In that same directory, create a soft link: `ln -s xmlshow.sh xmlshow`

*Voil√†*, you should be all set.
 
## Tips

The [less](https://ss64.com/bash/less.html) utility has actually quite a few tricks up its sleeves.

Beside the usual commands, remember that:

 - `z`jumps one window forward
 - `w`jumps one window backward
 - **`h` calls a help, with plenty of good features you may not have suspected (use q to quit)**
 - To search for a pattern just type `/pattern`
